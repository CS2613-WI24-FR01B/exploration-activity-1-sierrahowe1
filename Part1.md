## Which package/library did you select?

 - For this exploration activity I selected the Asciimatices library which is used to create ASCII animations using different colors, fonts, and imports. This library is used by first creating a screen which initializes the environment where you will create your ASCII text-based animation. Using different functionalities of these imports and the basic functions of python, you can create animations like the one shown in the sample program.

## What is the package/library?

- The purpose if the Asciimatics library is be incorperated into interactive applications using its text-based animations. There are a lot of possibilities when it comes to this package such as, animations using text which are used by built-in effects including Stars(creating blinking stars in the background), Print(prints out the argument), Scroll(Scrolls text across the screen), colors in the renderer allow you to create colored text, backgrounds, sprites, etc., and creating text-based user interfaces with elements such as buttons, text-fields, keyboard interaction, etc.
  
- Using the Asciimatics library includes intsalling it with the command "pip install asciimatics". Below are some examples of ways you can use asciimatics:

This is a simple example of a program that read in a string as well as coorindates. The color magenta is saved in the variable COLOUR_MAGENTA and the bold font is created as A_BOLD. screen.print_at prints the result to the screen and sleep(10) puts the program to sleep after 10 seconds.

- Here is another simple example:


## What are the functionalities of the package/library?

- Some of the basic functionalities of this library include, creating text animations with ASCII values, turning images into ASCII images with color and in grey, creating sprites with ASCII values, and working with different fonts in the FigletText library.

## When was it created?

- Asciimatics was created by Peter Brittain in 2016 when it was initially commited on GitHub.

## Why did you select this package/library?

- I chose to work with Asciimatics because I though it would be a good opportunity to get creative with my programming skills, which is something that I haven't had the chance to do in the past. I found it was also extremely different from anything we have learned in class and considered it a great way to expand my programming skills and knowledge.
