## Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?

- For this exploration activity I selected the Asciimatices library which is used to create ASCII animations using different colors, fonts, and imports. My sample program uses various differt functionalities involved with Asciimatics which begin with creating a screen with the import "asciimatics.screen" which initializes the environment where you will create your ASCII text-based animation, creating a scene using "asciimatics.scene" to create structure in your program, making it easier to manage if you choose to work with more complex animations, "asciimatics.effects" which is used to apply various effects such as animations and transitions to text, "asciimatics.particles" is used to create particle effects such as fireworks and explotions, "asciimatics.renderers" is used to define text with fonts and colors, "random" was used to access random integers in a certain range using "randInt()" and "choice" to select an element from a list. Using different functionalities of these imports and the basic functions of python, you can create animations like the one shown in the sample program.

## How would someone run your program?

- When using Asciimatics, you would first have to create a virtual environemnt in order to install the library using the command "python3 -m venv .venv" and then activate the environemnt though the following command, "source .venv/Scripts/activate". Now that you have activated your virtual environment, you can now install the Asciimatics library using the command "pip install asciimatics". Run the program in the terminal window like a regualr python file, "python3 filename.py" and the program should run.

## What purpose does your program serve?

- Asciimatics is used to create text-based animations using ASCII values. You can manipulate colours, fonts, images in color or grey using various imports that come with the library. My program is definetely for creative and entertainment purposes and could be used for creating my own games.

## What would be some sample input/output?
- Sample input/output:
